# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## How to

To **build** the project, run unit tests, and **deploy** the stack:

```shell
# Syntax
pnpm run deploy {stageName} {awsProfileName?}

# Example
pnpm run deploy next skypilot
````

---

To **build** the stack without deploying:

```shell
pnpm run build:cdk {stageName}
```

The generated files are not used in the `deploy` script, because that script builds the stack before deploying it.

## Useful commands

* `pnpm run build:tsc` compile typescript to js
* `pnpm run watch`     watch for changes and compile
* `pnpm test`       perform the unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
