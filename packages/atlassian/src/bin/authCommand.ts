  status  Report which source would supply the token, printing the token nowhere

At a terminal, \`set\` prompts for the token twice and echoes nothing; piped, it reads stdin and drops one
trailing newline, since \`echo\` adds one.

\`status\` names the first of JIRA_API_TOKEN, a configured command, and the keychain that would supply it. It
probes the keychain for presence rather than reading it, so it raises no keychain access prompt; a configured
command does run, and its output is discarded. Presence is not contents: An item containing only whitespace is
reported here and dropped by the resolver, which \`set\` refuses to create.`,
